        *** MAJOR INTERFACE CHANGES ***

        - new base classes HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter and
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter
        - some useful built-in filter classes:
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::htmlparser
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::htmltext
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::lines
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::simple
          HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::tags
          HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter::simple
          HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter::standard
        - tests for the internal class HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack
        - tests for the built-in filters
        - the examples are up-to-date with the new interface 
        - new/enhanced accessors:
          + the proxy host() attribute becomes actually useful: by default,
            the proxy is only usable by local user-agents (the socket
            is bound to localhost)
          + the filters proxy() accessor gives access to the proxy itself.
            For example, one can get the IP address of the agent connected
            to the proxy from inside a filter ($self->proxy->daemon->peerhost)
        - many documentation changes

        This version is NOT compatible with the previous ones
        regarding the way filters work.

        - maxserve is now correctly handled
        - corrected a bug in the t/20keepalive.t test file that
          made the tests fail on some machines

0.08  Thu Mar 13 01:41:42 CET 2003
        - cleaned up support for filters
        - added support for "buffering" filters
          and a new HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack class
        - added an anonymiser script (eg/anonymiser.pl)
        - the tests won't break if a local proxy is configured
        - the interfaces are very likely to change soon

        - the proxy now supports persistent connexions (Yay!)
        - and tests to check for it
        - and a new timeout accessor

0.06  Mon Feb 17 00:21:37 CET 2003
        - better forking system and better reaping of zombies
          (thanks to David Landgren and Stéphane Payrard)
          Still won't work under Windows, though :-(
        - replaced verbose() by logmask(), so as to fine-tune
          the logging system
        - put some of the test functions in a test module (t::Utils)

0.05  Tue Feb  4 00:47:23 CET 2003
        - explicitly refuse CONNECT
        - better support for TRACE method
        - support the Via: Header (a MUST in RFC 2616)
        - filters, but this needs more work

0.04  Sat Nov 30 12:19:22 CET 2002
        - accept connection from other hosts
        - better ftp support (no test yet)
        - basic gopher support (no test yet)
        - better HTTP error handling
        - use CRLF in HTTP headers

        - url() method gives a url to reach the proxy
        - new 'control' attribute defines the control URL
        - better subprocess management by preforking child processes
          (thanks to Eric Cholet)
        - a children handles only one request at a time, for better
          performance (this means we only do HTTP/1.0 for now)
        - correctly handle the Proxy-Connection and Connection headers

0.02  Thu Oct 24 23:45:08 CEST 2002
        - the system now forks to handle several connections
